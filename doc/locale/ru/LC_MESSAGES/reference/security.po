msgid "Security in Odoo"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:7
msgid ""
"Aside from manually managing access using custom code, Odoo provides two "
"main data-driven mechanisms to manage or restrict access to data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:10
msgid ""
"Both mechanisms are linked to specific users through *groups*: a user "
"belongs to any number of groups, and security mechanisms are associated to "
"groups, thus applying security mechamisms to users."

msgid "Access Control"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:19
msgid ""
"Managed by the ``ir.model.access`` records, defines access to a whole model."

#: ../../reference/security.rst:21
msgid ""
"Each access control has a model to which it grants permissions, the "
"permissions it grants and optionally a group."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:24
msgid ""
"Access controls are additive, for a given model a user has access all "
"permissions granted to any of its groups: if the user belongs to group *A* "
"which allows writing and group *B* which allows deleting, he can both write "
"and delete."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:29
msgid ""
"If no group is specified, the access control applies to all users, otherwise"
" it only applies to the users belonging to the specific group."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:32
msgid ""
"Available permissions are creation (``perm_create``), searching and reading "
"(``perm_read``), updating existing records (``perm_write``) and deleting "
"existing records (``perm_unlink``)"

msgid "Record Rules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:41
msgid ""
"Record rules are conditions that records must satisfy for an operation "
"(create, read, update or delete) to be allowed. It is applied record-by-"
"record after access control has been applied."

"a set of permissions to which it applies (e.g. if ``perm_read`` is set, the "
"rule will only be checked when reading a record)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:50
msgid ""
"a set of user groups to which the rule applies, if no group is specified the"
" rule is *global*"

msgid ""
"a :ref:`domain <reference/orm/domains>` used to check whether a given record"
" matches the rule (and is accessible) or does not (and is not accessible). "
"The domain is evaluated with two variables in context: ``user`` is the "
"current user's record and ``time`` is the `time module`_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:57
msgid ""
"Global rules and group rules (rules restricted to specific groups versus "
"groups applying to all users) are used quite differently:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:60
msgid ""
"Global rules are subtractive, they *must all* be matched for a record to be "
"accessible"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:62
msgid ""
"Group rules are additive, if *any* of them matches (and all global rules "
"match) then the record is accessible"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/security.rst:65
msgid ""
"This means the first *group rule* restricts access, but any further *group "
"rule* expands it, while *global rules* can only ever restrict access (or "
"have no effect)."
